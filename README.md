A simple JavaScript game I made in 1st year which allows userâ€™s images to be transferred into a puzzle with moving pieces



Website needs to be deployed on a server, otherwise errror: 
"script.js:130 Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'getImageData' on 'CanvasRenderingContext2D': The canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data.
    at Image.canvasBackgroundImage.onload (file:///Users/Admin/Code/GitHub/Moving-Puzzles/htdocs/scripts/script.js:130:32)"
    will occur.
